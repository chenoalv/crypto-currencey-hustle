## Key Aspects of Music Engineering

- **Recording:** Capturing audio using various types of microphones and recording equipment.
- **Mixing:** Blending multiple audio tracks to create a balanced and cohesive sound.
- **Mastering:** Preparing and transferring recorded audio for distribution.
- **Sound Design:** Creating and manipulating audio elements for various media.
- **Acoustics:** Understanding and optimizing the behavior of sound in different environments.

## Tools of the Trade

Music engineers work with a variety of tools, including:

- Digital Audio Workstations (DAWs)
- Microphones and Preamps
- Audio Interfaces
- Studio Monitors and Headphones
- Signal Processors (EQs, Compressors, etc.)
- MIDI Controllers
