    <h1>Understanding Beats in Music Production</h1>

    <p>In music production, a beat is the basic unit of rhythm. It's the steady pulse that you feel when listening to music, often emphasized by percussion instruments like drums. Understanding beats is crucial for creating well-structured and rhythmically engaging music.</p>
