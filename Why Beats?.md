# The Physics of Beats


At its core, the creation of beats is a result of interference between sound waves. 
When two sound waves with slightly different frequencies are played simultaneously, their amplitudes (loudness) can either add up or cancel each other out. 
This alternating pattern of constructive and destructive interference creates the rhythmic pulsation we perceive as beats.
